                  <p>We know how hard it can be to buy a product online. It doesn't matter how much research and how good the pictures are; you still don't know how good it is or if you've made the right choice until you get it in your home, right?</p>
                  <p>So we want to give you extra time to ensure you've made the right decision,<span> in fact 100 Days!</span></p>

                  <p>Your 100-day period starts from your day of delivery.</p>
                  <p>All we ask is the product must be returned in a re-saleable condition, which includes being in the original, unmarked and undamaged packaging, and in good condition. It's only fair we have a chance to resell the product.</p>
                  <p>And you'll pay a small collection fee, usually around £100, or you can take it to a collection point and pay £50.</p>
